    <h1>Violent Studio Software Development Kit</h1>
    <p>VSDK is a software development kit developed by Violent Studio for internal use. However, it is also permitted to be used outside the studio, provided that the user adheres to the terms of the licence in such an instance. VSDK comprises a number of modules, including those that facilitate the execution of utilities. These include the Shader Editor, the Camera Animator, and so forth. It is imperative that the VSDK backend is Raylib; therefore, it is imperative that VSDK is used exclusively with Raylib. Despite the fact that VSDK contains a number of useful tools that can be employed with alternative backends, as previously mentioned, such as the shader editor, there is also a dedicated module for this purpose. VLib (Violent Library). VLib contains a number of useful extensions, including those for working with TCP or UDP sockets (Vinet or Violent Immediate mode Networking) and EzXML for working with XML. In general, the VSDK library is comprehensive and readily extensible. VSDK enables the rapid creation of spatial audio, bump mapping, particle simulation, immediate user interfaces, more convenient vector manipulation, and dozens of pre-built mathematical computational functions, among other capabilities. VSDK is currently in active development and is not yet at a point of fundamental stability.</p>
